### Inspiration: https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2016
###### The object of the game is to destroy the bombs before they explode. Bombs disappear after the user draws their associated shapes with the mouse in the correct sequence. As the game progresses, bombs appear with more shapes and at an increasingly fast pace.
